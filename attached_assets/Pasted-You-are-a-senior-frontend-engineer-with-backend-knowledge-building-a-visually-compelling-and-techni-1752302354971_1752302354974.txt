You are a senior frontend engineer with backend knowledge, building a visually compelling and technically impressive portfolio website using React.js.
The portfolio represents a Software Engineer with strong experience in real-time data streaming, Apache Kafka, and automated testing of distributed systems.

🎯 Your goal: Create a standout personal portfolio that reflects deep expertise in scalable systems, streaming architecture, and robust test engineering. This site should appeal to companies hiring for data-intensive platforms, backend streaming pipelines, or Kafka-focused roles.

✅ Key Sections to Include:

Hero Section

Bold animated title: “Hi, I'm [Your Name] — I build and test real-time systems.”
